      <p>
        At the beginning of 2024, I embraced the challenge of changing my career and entering the IT world. Through months of independent work and completion of an intensive Web Developer course, I gained a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and began to explore React and Scrum methodology.

        With a futuristic vision and a commitment to excellence, I am determined to leverage my knowledge, organizational skills, and dedication to succeed as a professional programmer. Let's create something extraordinary together!
